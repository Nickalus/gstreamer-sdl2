GStreamer rendering to an SDL2 texture

This code is very ugly, lacks some error checking, and has some (known and unknown) bugs. Use with caution.

We use the videotestsrc source to generate a video test pattern, and then use an app\_sink to extract frames and
put them on the display using an SDL2 SDL\_Texture. Unlike existing GStreamer sinks, this can be easily mixed with
other things going on in an SDL2 application.
